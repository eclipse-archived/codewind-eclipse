# Codewind for Eclipse
Create and develop cloud-native, containerized web applications from Eclipse.

## Installing Codewind for Eclipse
You can install Codewind locally in Eclipse. For more information about installing Codewind, see [Getting started: Codewind for Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsegettingstarted.html).

Prerequisites
- Download and install the latest [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/) or use an existing installation.
    - Install Eclipse IDE Version 2019-09 R (4.13.0) or later to avoid [Bug 541220](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541220).
    - However, the earliest supported version of the Eclipse IDE is Version 2019-06 (4.12).
- Install Docker 17.06 or later.
- If you use Linux, you also need to install Docker Compose.

Complete the installation:
1. Install [Codewind from the Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind).
2. Open the **Codewind Explorer** view. Go to **Window**>**Show View**>**Otherâ€¦**>**Codewind**>**Codewind Explorer**.
3. Double-click the **Local** entry in the view to finish installing Codewind. The download is approximately 1 GB. For more information, see [Installing Codewind for Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-eclipse-installinfo.html).

## Using Codewind for Eclipse
Right-click the **Local** entry in the view to create new projects or add existing projects to Codewind. After a project is created or added, it displays in the **Codewind Explorer** view. Right-click the project to see the available actions.

[Features:](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsemanagingprojects.html)</br>
- **Open Application**: Opens the application in the default Eclipse browser. This action is only available when the application is running or debugging.

- **Import Project**: Imports your project into the Eclipse workspace.
- **Disable/Enable Project**: Disables or enables the project.
- **Show Log Files**: If log files are available, this action displays a list of log files. Click **Show All** or an individual log file toggle action to open the log file in the Eclipse **Console** view. Click the log file again to remove the log file, or click **Hide All** to remove all log files from the **Console** view.
- **Restart in Run Mode**: Restarts the application in run mode.
- **Restart in Debug Mode**: Restarts the application in debug mode and attaches the debugger. Only MicroProfile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js projects can be debugged. For more information, see [Debugging Codewind projects](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsedebugproject.html).
- **Attach Debugger**: If you detached the debugger accidentally or restarted Eclipse, use this action to re-attach the debugger to an application in debug mode. For more information, see [Debugging Codewind projects](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsedebugproject.html).
- **Build**: Initiate a build of your project. This action is not available if a build is already running. For more information, see [Building Codewind projects](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsebuildproject.html).
- **Disable Auto Build**: Use this to disable automatic builds if you are making a lot of changes and don't want builds to be triggered until you are done. This action is available only when auto build is enabled.
- **Enable Auto Build**: Use this to re-enable automatic builds whenever a change is made. This action is available only when auto build is disabled.
- **Remove**: Removes a project. This action removes the project from Codewind and optionally deletes the project files from the file system.
- **Refresh**: If the project gets out of sync, use this option to refresh it. To refresh all projects, right-click the **Local** item in the **Codewind Explorer** view and select **Refresh**.

## Enabling debug logs
1. Create an `.options` file in your Eclipse install directory, the same directory with the `eclipse` executable. Include the following content in the new file:
```
org.eclipse.codewind.core/debug/info=true
```
2. Launch Eclipse with the `-debug` flag.
3. The logs are written to the Eclipse workspace directory to `.metadata/.log`.

## Building
1. Clone the repository to your system:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-eclipse
 ```
2. (Optional:) To get a test build, copy the `codewind-eclipse` folder to the `build` directory to keep your source folder intact.
3. Run a Gradle build:
```
cd build/dev
./gradlew
```
4. Test the driver built from the Gradle build:
```
build/dev/ant_build/artifacts/codewind-[Version].vYYYYMMDD_hhmm.zip
```

## Developing Codewind for Eclipse
- Download and install the latest [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/) or use an existing installation. The earliest supported version of the Eclipse IDE for Codewind for Eclipse is 4.11.0 (2019-03).
- Clone the repository to your system:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-eclipse
 ```
- From the `codewind-eclipse/dev` directory run `gradlew getDependencies` to download the dependency jars.
- The extension bundles dependency executables. These are gitignored, but should be kept up-to-date on your local system with the same versions used in the `Jenkinsfile` `parameters` section. Run `dev/org.eclipse.codewind.core/binaries/meta-pull.sh` to pull down the required scripts from the codewind-vscode repository, then run `dev/org.eclipse.codewind.core/binaries/pull.sh` to download the dependencies. Also see `dev/org.eclipse.codewind.core/binaries/README.txt`, and the downloaded `dev/org.eclipse.codewind.core/binaries/README-pull.txt`.
- Open the **Git Repositories** view in Eclipse and click on the **Add an existing local Git Repository to this view** toolbar button.
- Fill in the location of your repository clone and finish the wizard.
- Right-click on the repository you just created, select **Import Projects**, and import all of the `org.eclipse.codewind.*` projects.
- Modify the code and then use the Eclipse self-hosting feature to test and debug your changes:
    1. Click **Run** > **Debug Configurations** and create a new debug launch configuration of type **Eclipse Application**.
    2. Modify the workspace location if you want.
    3. For **Program to Run**, choose **Run a product** and select **org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product** from the drop down list.
    4. You can work with different versions of the Codewind images by adding the **CW_TAG** environment variable in the **Environment** tab. Set it to **latest** to get the latest images or to a specific tag such as **0.3**.
    5. To launch the self-hosted Eclipse and begin your testing, click the **Debug** button when you are finished.

## Running Tests on Codewind for Eclipse
- The tests are located in the `org.eclipse.codewind.test` project and are JUnit tests.
- Tests can be run individually or there are two test lists:
    - **AllTests**: This includes all of the tests.
    - **BuildVerificationTests**: This is the subset of tests that are run with the build.
- To run the tests create a new run configuration in Eclipse of type **JUnit Plug-in Test**:
    - Set **Test runner** to `JUnit 4`. Do this first otherwise the **Search** button for the test class will not work.
    - Set **Project** to `org.eclipse.codewind.test`.
    - Set **Test class** to the test case or test list you want to run.
    - (Optional) Un-check **Run in UI thread**. This allows you to interact with the Eclipse instance running the test.
    - Click the **Run** button.
    
## Developing Codewind images
- Make sure to use the **Codewind Explorer** view in Eclipse to uninstall any current Codewind images before starting. If Codewind is installed, right click on **Codewind** in the view and select **Uninstall**.
- To work with the Codewind images, clone this repository to your system:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/eclipse/codewind
 ```
- Use an editor of your choice to make changes to the code.
- Build and run Codewind using [`run.sh`](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/blob/master/run.sh).
- When it is running you can right-click **Codewind** in the **Codewind Explorer** view in Eclipse and select **Refresh** to pick up the newly running Codewind images.
