Usage: ./meta-pull.sh

Pulls the scripts to download the Appsody and Codewind binaries from
the codewind-vscode repository.

You can optionally pass a parameter to specify which branch to pull
from.  If no branch is specified, 'master' will be used.  After
running this script, you must run './pull.sh'.  See the downloaded
README-pull.txt for details on how to run the pull.sh script.
